# Enterprise Contribution  

Open Nexus is not just a community project.  
It is a platform designed to power the next generation of devices — and that means industry matters.  

We welcome enterprises not only as sponsors, but as **co-builders**.  
This is about more than writing checks. It’s about shaping the future together.  

## Why partner with us?  

- **Shared vision** — align with a global push for open, secure, and sovereign technology.  
- **Early access** — to infrastructure, SDKs, and the ecosystem as it grows.  
- **Real influence** — help define standards that will impact industries for decades.  

Financial support accelerates the roadmap — but the true value lies in partnership.  
We are looking for companies that believe, as we do, that the best system is built in the open,  
and that real sovereignty is possible only when industry and community move together.
