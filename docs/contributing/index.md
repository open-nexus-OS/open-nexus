# Contributing  

So youâ€™ve found us â€” [open-nexus-os.io](https://open-nexus-os.io).  
Thatâ€™s the front door, the story, the vision.  

But the real work happens in code and in community.  
Our main repo lives on GitHub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [github.com/open-nexus-OS/open-nexus-OS](https://github.com/open-nexus-OS/open-nexus-OS)  

We use GitHub to reach developers worldwide,  
but most modules are being migrated to our own GitLab:  
ðŸ‘‰ [gitlab.open-nexus-os.io/open-nexus-os](https://gitlab.open-nexus-os.io/open-nexus-os)  

Thatâ€™s where day-to-day development takes place.
