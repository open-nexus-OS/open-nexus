## Why Apache 2.0?  

Because true openness means *no walls*.  

- Developers can fork, extend, and remix.  
- Companies can build on it, even with closed extensions.  
- Everyone benefits from a common, stable foundation.  

It’s not about ideology.  
It’s about building the **best system possible** — and ensuring it can thrive in the real world, with support from industry and community alike.
