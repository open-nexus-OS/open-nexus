# Contribution Workflow  

Open Nexus is a young project, but one thing is already clear:  
quality matters more than speed.  

We want contributions to feel open, but also reliable.  
That’s why every change goes through review before it becomes part of the system.  

---

## How it works  

1. **Fork and propose a change**  
   - Fix a bug, improve the docs, or add a feature.  
   - Keep it focused. Small, clear changes are easier to review.  

2. **Review and testing**  
   - At least two maintainers must check and approve the change.  
   - Automated tests run for Rust code and hardware emulation.  
   - If it passes both humans and machines, it’s ready.  

3. **Merging**  
   - **Small changes** (typos, bugfixes, small UI tweaks) → maintainers can merge directly.  
   - **Big ideas** (new modules, architecture shifts) → go through an **RFC** (*Request for Comments*).  
     Write up the idea, explain the “why”, and let the community discuss.

## Why this matters  

This workflow keeps the codebase stable without killing creativity.  
It means nobody can push broken code into main, but everybody can propose ideas.  

In short:  
**Easy to join. Hard to break. Built to last.**
