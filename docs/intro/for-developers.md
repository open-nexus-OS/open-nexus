# Build the Future of Computing  

## A New Beginning  

Most operating systems you know were designed in another era.  
They were built for single machines, for closed ecosystems, for companies that wanted control.  

They carry decades of legacy code. Layers of compromises.  
And they were never meant for the world we live in today.  

We get to start fresh.  
With Rust. With RISC-V. With our neuron microkernel.  
A foundation that is secure by design. Modern. Open.  
Not bound by the past – built for what’s next.  

This is your chance to help write the story of a new operating system.  
Not a product to consume.  
But a platform to shape.  
A platform where developers are not just users – they are co-creators.

## Why Contribute?  

We’re not fixing the old world.  
We’re building a new one.  

- Work at the frontier of **Rust systems programming**.  
- Shape an OS **without legacy baggage** – everything is greenfield.  
- See your code run **across form factors** – from smartphones to IoT to desktops.  
- Help define **open standards** instead of being trapped in proprietary silos.  
- Be part of a global movement to create **a real alternative to Android**.  

Every contribution matters. Whether it’s kernel code, UI design, documentation, testing or just shring our story.  
This isn’t about adding lines of code.  
It’s about shaping the future of tech sovereignty – and beyond.
