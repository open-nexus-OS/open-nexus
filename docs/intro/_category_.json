"description": "The story of Open Nexus OS begins with a simple belief:\ncomputing should serve people, not platforms.\n\nToday, every device is a walled garden.\nYour phone, your desktop, your car — each trapped in its own ecosystem.\nWe think that’s backwards.\n\nOpen Nexus is our answer:\na unified, open operating system built in Rust, powered by a Redox microkernel,\nand designed to run everywhere — mobile, desktop, IoT, and beyond.\n\nThis chapter introduces the vision, the people we’re building it for,\nand the roadmap that will take us there."
