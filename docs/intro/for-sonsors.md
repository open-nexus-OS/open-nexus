# Invest in Digital Sovereignty  

## The Future Starts Here  

Every once in a while, a new technology comes along that changes everything.  
The transistor. The personal computer. The smartphone.  

Today, we stand at the next inflection point.  

For decades, the world has been running on platforms controlled by a handful of corporations.  
Operating systems that lock us in. Ecosystems designed to serve their shareholders, not their users.  

But the world is changing.  
RISC-V is opening hardware.  
Rust is making systems programming safe again.  
And with Open Nexus, we have the chance to build the first truly open, unified operating system.  

Not European. Not American. Not Asian.  
**Global. Human. Ours.**

## Why It Matters  

This is not about another app.  
Not about another product.  
This is about building the digital foundation for the next fifty years.  

- An OS that runs across every device.  
- An OS that puts privacy before profit.  
- An OS that no single company can control.  

This is about sovereignty — for nations, for industries, for people.  
A chance to reclaim computing as a **public good**, not a corporate monopoly.
