# Why we need another OS: The vision of a Unified Open Ecosystem

## The Next Evolution of Computing

For decades, every new device promised freedom.  
But instead, we got **more walls**. More silos. More complexity.  

We believe it’s time for something different.  
An operating system where every device becomes part of **one seamless whole**.  
Where your watch extends your desktop.  
Where your car speaks the same language as your phone.  
Where your smart home is not tied to a single brand.  

Not because of proprietary clouds.  
But because it’s **open**. Because it’s **yours**.

## The Core Problem

Today’s digital world is broken:

- **Artificial categories** — phones, desktops, watches, all living in different worlds.  
- **Closed ecosystems** — apps rewritten, experiences duplicated.  
- **Cloud dependence** — your so-called “unified” experience lives on someone else’s servers.  

This is not innovation. It’s limitation.

## Why This Matters Now

### For Users

- **Freedom of choice** — mix brands, no more lock-in.  
- **Your data stays with you** — peer-to-peer sync, no middlemen.  
- **One adaptive interface** — from pocket to desktop, always familiar.  

### For Developers

- **One codebase, all devices** — build once, run everywhere.  
- **No more fragmentation** — shared APIs for every form factor.  
- **Real rewards** — contribute and earn, not just applause.  

### For Industry

Every device is an endpoint. Not just the desktop.  

From tablets to smartwatches, from cars to IoT:  
**one platform, one standard, one ecosystem.**
