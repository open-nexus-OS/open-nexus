# Why we need another OS: The vision of a Unified Open Ecosystem

## The Next Evolution of Computing

We're creating an OS where devices become **virtualized resources** in a self-organizing network. Your workflow transcends hardware - a watch extends your desktop, your EV integrates with your smart home - through open standards, not proprietary silos.

## Core Problem

Today's computing experience is fragmented across:

- **Artificial device categories** (phone/desktop/watch) all on different architectures
- **Incompatible ecosystems** requiring duplicate apps
- **Cloud lock-in** where your "unified" experience depends on third-party servers

## Why This Matters Now

### For Users

- **True device interoperability** - Mix brands without compatibility issues
- **Your data stays local** - Peer-to-peer sync replaces cloud dependence
- **One adaptive interface** - UI scales seamlessly across form factors

### For Developers

- **Write once, deploy everywhere** - with RISC-V/Rust foundation
- **No more fragmentation** - Common APIs for all device classes
- **Earn bounties** - for core contributions (upcoming soon)

### For Industry

| Advantage         | Impact |
|------------------|----------------|
| 60% lower R&D    | One codebase for all product lines |
| Future-proof     | RISC-V architecture ensures longevity |
| Regulatory-ready | Built-in GDPR/cybersecurity compliance |
