# Roadmap

## What We’re Doing

We’re not adding features. We’re building the layers of a new foundation.

---

## The Journey Ahead

**1) Proof of Concept**  
A Login and a Launcher that switches between Desktop and Mobile. Show it runs. Prove the core works.  

**2) Core Foundation**  
Resource management, first libraries, and the basics that make an OS more than a demo.  
Align with open standards, not ad-hoc hacks.  

**3) UI Framework**  
A native, declarative layer for building apps. Clean APIs, modern design.  
The system should look and feel as seamless as it runs.  

**4) Nexus Studio (DSL)**  
Our developer studio: a SwiftUI/Qt-like DSL built for Rust.  
Write once, deploy across every device.  

**5) System Modules**  
Media, accounts, notifications, storage, networking.  
The things users expect—delivered the open way.  

**6) Core Infrastructure**  
Security framework, package manager, update system.  
The invisible work that makes everything else reliable.  

**7) Performance & Monitoring**  
Measure, tune, optimize.  
Not hype—just rock-solid speed, stability, and insight.  

**8) Enterprise & Advanced**  
Device management, compliance, IoT, ML.  
For the companies who will trust this platform at scale.

## How We’ll Ship

Slice by slice. Every milestone usable, every release testable.  
From a booting kernel → to a daily-driver shell → to an ecosystem.  

Not rewrites for sport. Not roadmaps on slides.  
Just code, progress, and momentum.
