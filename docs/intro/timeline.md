# Roadmap

## What We’re Doing

We’re not adding features. We’re building the layers of a new foundation.

---

## The Journey Ahead

**1) Kernel Foundation**
NEURON microkernel, capability-based IPC, process isolation.
Prove the security model works. Show services can communicate safely.

**2) Core Services & Persistence**
Service manager, bundle manager, policy engine, virtual filesystem, durable storage.
The invisible foundation that makes everything else possible.

**3) UI Foundation**
Window manager, compositor, basic rendering, SystemUI.
A native interface that feels fast and responsive.

**4) DSL & Developer Experience**
Nexus DSL: a SwiftUI/Qt-like framework for Rust.
Write once, deploy everywhere. Developer tools that make building apps simple.

**5) System Modules**
Media, audio, input, display, networking, sensors, power management.
The services users expect—delivered the open way.

**6) Graphics & Performance**
NexusGfx SDK, GPU drivers, performance monitoring.
Not hype—just solid speed, stability, and insight.

**7) Enterprise & Advanced**
Device management, compliance, distributed systems (DSoftBus), ML acceleration.
For organizations that will trust this platform at scale.

## How We’ll Ship

Slice by slice. Every milestone usable, every release testable.  
From a booting kernel → to a daily-driver shell → to an ecosystem.  

Not rewrites for sport. Not roadmaps on slides.  
Just code, progress, and momentum.
