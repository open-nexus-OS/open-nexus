## The Redox Beginning

When I first started Open Nexus, I took the pragmatic path:  
build on Redox's proven microkernel, focus on the UI layer, ship faster.

It worked. We had a login screen, a launcher, a control center.  
The foundation felt solid. Redox was Rust-native, microkernel-based, open source.  
What could go wrong?

## The Realization

<!-- truncate -->

Redox has a different goal: **Linux with Rust and a microkernel**.  
That's a valid direction — but it's not ours.

The deeper I dug, the clearer it became:

- **Wayland** is designed to be as powerful as possible, not optimized for microseconds or zero-copy efficiency
- **Battery life** wasn't a first-class concern in the architecture
- **Performance** was good enough, not exceptional
- The ecosystem was built for compatibility, not for pushing boundaries

We weren't building a better Linux.  
We were building something fundamentally different.

## Building Our Own Foundation

So we started over.

**NEURON** — our own microkernel, built from scratch.  
**Capability-based security** — not bolted on, but architected in from day one.  
**RISC-V only** — no legacy baggage, no x86 compromises.  
**Zero-copy data planes** — VMOs and filebuffers end-to-end.  
**Host-first testing** — validate logic fast, validate truth in QEMU.

This isn't about reinventing the wheel.  
It's about building a wheel that fits our exact needs.

## Why This Matters

Every decision we make now serves one goal:  
**Speed, efficiency, and security — not as features, but as architecture.**

- **Microsecond latency** isn't a nice-to-have — it's a requirement
- **Zero-copy** isn't an optimization — it's the default
- **Battery life** isn't an afterthought — it's designed in
- **Capability security** isn't a layer — it's the foundation

We're not trying to be compatible with everything.  
We're trying to be **better** at what matters.

## The Road Ahead

We're past the proof of concept.  
We're building the foundation that will power everything else.

Every line of code, every architectural decision, every keystone gate we close —  
it's all moving toward one vision:  
an OS that's fast, efficient, and secure by design, not by accident.

This is just the beginning.  
But it's the right beginning.

**Open Nexus** is not a fork anymore.  
It's its own system, with its own kernel, its own architecture, its own future.  
And we're just getting started.
