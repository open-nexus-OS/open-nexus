## From Vision to Structure  

When we first introduced Open Nexus, it was only an idea — an alternative to fragmented ecosystems, built on Rust and a Redox microkernel.  
Today, that idea has taken shape. The foundation of the project is no longer abstract; it is code, libraries, and a working environment.  

- GitHub for visibility, GitLab for day-to-day development  
- A clear project structure with modular components  
- Scripts for **initial-setup, build, and run** — so contributors can get started quickly  

## From Orbital Fork to Open Nexus  

<!-- truncate -->

What began as a fork of Orbital has been transformed into something new:  

- **Login screen** with a clean, aesthetic design  
- **Action Bar** for notifications and quick access  
- **Control Center** with Dark/Light mode switching and Mobile/Desktop adaptation  
- **Modern Menu** integrated into a new designed bar  
- **Completely new icon system** — SVG-based, scalable, future-proof  

This is not just polish. It’s a foundation that scales with modern hardware and modern expectations.  

## Technical Advances  

Beneath the surface, the architecture has grown deeper roots:  

- **Event system overhauled** — safer, cleaner, built for extensibility  
- **Icon & theme library** — one place to manage visuals and colors  
- **Local config persistence** — settings that survive reboots  
- **State machine** to orchestrate predictable system behavior  
- **Acrylic glass UI effect** — lighter on CPU, smoother for users  

Together, these elements mark a step from prototype hacks to a system with its own identity.  

## The Road Ahead  

We are approaching our first milestone: **a proof of concept**.  
Not yet a full OS, not yet production-ready — but enough to demonstrate what an open, adaptive, single-device experience can look like.  

It’s the first time our vision becomes tangible.  
And it’s only the beginning.

**Open Nexus** is moving fast. With every line of Rust, with every design decision, we are turning possibility into reality. The proof of concept is near — and with it, the first glimpse of a different future for computing.
