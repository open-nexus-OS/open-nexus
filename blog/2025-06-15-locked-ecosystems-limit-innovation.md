## The Problem: Locked Ecosystems Limit Innovation

Today's devices force us into walled gardens:

- **Smartphones ‚â† Desktops**: Different OSes, disjointed workflows
- **Cloud-Dependent**: Your "ecosystem" relies on third-party sync
- **Hardware Silos**: A Desktop App can't adapt to a Tablet
- **Proprietary Eco Systems**: Forces everyone to develop their own

**This isn't just inconvenient - it's a fundamental design flaw.**

## Our Vision: One OS, Any Device

Introducing **open nexus**: A Rust-based microkernel OS designed for **adaptive computing**.

<!-- truncate -->

### What Makes This Possible?

‚úÖ **Single Codebase**  

- From wearables to workstations - same OS, tailored UI, adaptable microkernel
- No more redeveloping apps for different architectures

‚úÖ **Hardware-Agnostic**  

- RISC-V foundation ensures portability  
- Modular drivers for diverse devices  

‚úÖ **User-Centric Workflow**  

- Your tasks follow *you*, not your device type  
- I just works

## For Developers: Build Without Boundaries

We're pioneering what others can't - because we're:
üîì **100% Open Source** (Apache 2.0)  
üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-First**  

- Write once, deploy anywhere (no fragmentation)  
- Influence the future of adaptive interfaces  

**Join the Core Team:**  

1. Contribute to our [GitHub](https://github.com/open-nexus-OS) (we mentor!)  
2. Earn bounties for [priority issues](/docs/intro/timeline)  (upcoming soon)
3. Help define the **adaptive UI standard**

## For Sponsors: Own the Future of Adaptive Tech

**Why This Matters for Industry:**  

- **First-mover advantage** in unified computing  
- **Reduce R&D costs** (one OS for all product lines)  
- **Tax incentives** for EU sovereignty projects  

**Partner With Us:**  

- Fund specific modules (security, GPU acceleration)  
- Co-develop for your hardware

## What's Next?

- **Q3 2025**: Proof-of-concept on PineTab/VisionFive  
- **Q4 2025**: Developer preview with adaptive UI toolkit  

**Let's build the OS the industry said was impossible.**
