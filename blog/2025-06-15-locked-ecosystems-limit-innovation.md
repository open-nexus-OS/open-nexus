## The Problem: Fragmented by Design  

For decades, computing has been divided into artificial categories:  
a phone OS here, a desktop OS there, a watch or car system somewhere else.  
Each locked into its own ecosystem. Each dependent on proprietary cloud sync.  
Each forcing developers to rewrite the same ideas for different silos.  

This isn’t just inconvenient.  
It is a fundamental design flaw — a brake on progress.  

## The Vision: One OS. Many Devices  

**Open Nexus** is built to break these barriers.  
A Rust-based microkernel (Redox foundation) with a modular architecture,  
designed to adapt seamlessly from smartphones to workstations,  
from IoT devices to automotive platforms.  

Your workflow should not care where it runs.  
Your data should not depend on third-party servers.  
Your interface should not be bound to screen size.  

One system. One experience. Across an open ecosystem.

## What Makes This Different?  

- **Unified Core** – One codebase, one kernel, all devices.  
- **RISC-V First** – A future-proof, open architecture for Europe and beyond.  
- **Modular by Design** – Drivers and services that scale from small devices to enterprise fleets.  
- **User-Centric Workflow** – Your tasks, your data, your flow — local and peer-to-peer.  

## For Developers: A Platform Without Walls  

This is not a fork of the past. There is no legacy code to drag forward.  
Every line is new. Every module is built with Rust safety and modern design principles.  

- **Write once, deploy everywhere** – phones, tablets, desktops, IoT.  
- **Contribute in the open** – code, design, documentation, testing.  
- **Help define standards** – adaptive UIs, distributed services, resource management.

## For Partners: Building Infrastructure Together  

Open Nexus is more than a project — it’s infrastructure.  
And infrastructure is built with partners who think in decades, not quarters.  

- **Reduce R&D costs** – one OS across entire product lines.  
- **Compliance-ready** – privacy and security by default.  
- **Strategic sovereignty** – aligned with EU funding and global independence initiatives.

## What’s Next?  

- **2025: Proof of concept** on PineTab and VisionFive hardware.  
- **2026: Developer preview** with adaptive UI toolkit and SDK.  

We are building the system the industry said was impossible.  
If you share that conviction, now is the moment to step in.
