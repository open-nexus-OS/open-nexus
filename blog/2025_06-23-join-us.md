## Why We’re Here  

Every major shift in computing began with a small group of people who believed that the status quo was not enough.  
Today, that status quo is fragmentation: phones that don’t talk to desktops, ecosystems that trap you in silos, and platforms that put business models above users.  

We believe this is the moment to change that.  
And we’re building the system to prove it.  

## What Is Open Nexus?  

<!-- truncate -->

Open Nexus is a new operating system — written in **Rust**, built on a **Redox microkernel**, and designed from day one to be **modular, adaptive, and secure**.  
One OS for many devices. A seamless single-device experience across an open ecosystem.  

Not an Android skin. Not a fork of yesterday’s code.  
A foundation for what comes next.  

## Where We Stand  

We’re in the earliest phase — architectural groundwork, first prototypes, and UI concepts. That means two things:  

- Nothing is set in stone. Every contribution can shape the core.  
- This is the most exciting moment to be part of it.  

The roadmap ahead includes:  

- A declarative UI framework (Nexus Studio) for cross-device design  
- Android app compatibility via sandboxing  
- Native RISC-V support maybe soon on platforms like PineTab and VisionFive  
- Privacy-first sync without cloud lock-in  

## Who Should Join  

We’re not looking for the largest team. We’re looking for the right people:  

- Systems developers with Rust or kernel experience  
- Designers who care about simplicity and usability  
- Builders who thrive on modular architectures and scalable frameworks  
- Writers, testers, and advocates who want to help an ecosystem grow  

It doesn’t matter if you’re a seasoned engineer or just starting out.  
What matters is that you want to build, not just criticize.  

## Why This Matters  

Because in ten years, either we’re still locked into platforms that don’t serve us —  
or we’ve built the alternative ourselves.  

This isn’t about features. It’s about freedom, trust, and the kind of future we want technology to create.

Open Nexus is not the safe choice.  
It’s the bold one.  
If that excites you more than it scares you — then you’re already one of us.
