# Help Us Build the Future of Mobile OS – Join the NexOS Project!

Are you passionate about open-source, Rust, or RISC-V? Do you want to help shape a next-generation mobile operating system that’s privacy-respecting, modular, and designed for tomorrow's hardware?

Then **open nexus** needs you.

## What is open nexus?

open nexus is an open-source mobile operating system built from the ground up in **Rust**, with a strong focus on **privacy**, **openness**, and **interoperability**. It is based on the **Redox microkernel** and the beautifully modern **COSMIC desktop environment** (originally developed by System76).

Our goal? To create a secure, modular OS that runs across mobile and embedded platforms – fully open, community-driven, and libre.

## Where We Are

We are currently in the **early design phase**, developing the architectural foundation, user experience concepts, and development strategy. Our long-term roadmap includes:

- A modular app framework inspired by SwiftUI/QML
- Android compatibility (via sandboxing or translation layers)
- Native support for RISC-V platforms like PineTab V and VisionFive 2
- A fully open, privacy-first mobile ecosystem

I’m leading the project as a **UX/UI design expert and project manager** – working to bring this vision to life, both through hands-on design and project coordination. Now, I’m looking for like-minded pioneers to join me in building this from the ground up.

## Who We’re Looking For

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds, especially if you have experience or interest in:

- 🔧 **Rust** / OS & kernel development
- 📱 **Mobile UX/UI**, app design, or COSMIC/GTK work
- 📦 Build systems, packaging, and CI/CD pipelines
- 🧪 Testing on embedded or RISC-V hardware
- 📖 Writing documentation or developer tools
- 🌍 Community building and open governance

Whether you’re a seasoned systems programmer, a curious student, or an open-source enthusiast – there’s a place for you in NexOS.

## Why Join?

- Contribute to a project that values **freedom**, **privacy**, and **technological sovereignty**
- Help shape a truly libre alternative to Android
- Work on cutting-edge tech (Rust, microkernels, RISC-V, COSMIC)
- Be part of a respectful, collaborative community from day one
- Gain experience in a full-stack OS project – from kernel to UI
